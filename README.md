# QuantConnect Lean Stubs/API
## Autocomplete for Lean Python Algorithms and Additional Python Tools

![Build status](https://api.travis-ci.com/QuantConnect/quantconnect-lean.svg?branch=master)

To install the package with pip, run the following command.

 * `pip install quantconnect-lean`

Use your preferred IDE, and code on your algorithm like normal.

If you want to run your algorithm in the QuantConnect Cloud, we recommend installing Skylight to automatically sync local changes to the cloud: https://www.quantconnect.com/skylight

Note: this repo is undergoing constant changes, and does not provide complete QCAlgorithm type definitions (coming soon!)
